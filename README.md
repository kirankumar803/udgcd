# udgcd (UnDirected Graph Cycle Detection)

C++ wrapper over Boost Graph Library (aka BGL), provides a mean to detect cycles in a planar undirected graph.

For example, with the following graph generated by the included sample program:

![alt](
https://github.com/skramm/udgcd/blob/master/sample1_2.png "sample graph")

This code will give you the three cycles as three sets of vertices. These are sorted with the smallest vertex in first position, and such as the second vertices is always smaller than the last one (see [notes](#s_notes)):
```
1-6-5-4-3-2-
1-6-5-4-13-14-7-3-2-
3-7-14-13-4-
```

### Status
 <a name="s_stat"></a>
- UPDATE 2017/04: now works with user bundled properties for the edges, [see here](#note_bp).
- beta. Not extensively tested, but provides sample application code.
- Works for graphs holding unconnected sub-graphs.
- Modern C++ design'ed (RAII).
- Fairly generic, should be suited for pretty much all types of undirected graphs, as long as you can [order the vertices](#s_notes).
- Build upon [example](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/graph/example/undirected_dfs.cpp) taken from BGL manual
(also check [this page](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/graph/doc/undirected_dfs.html)).
Got some help from [sehe](http://stackoverflow.com/a/43481372/193789).
- Released under the Boost licence.

### Usage:
 <a name="s_usage"></a>

 1. Include the file `udgcd.hpp` in your application.
 1. Create your graph ([check this](#s_notes)).
 1. Build your graph (add vertices and edges, see BGL manual or the provided samples).
 1. Call `udgcd::FindCycles()`. It will return a set of paths that are cycles (1):

 `auto cycles = udgcd::FindCycles<my_graph_type,my_vertex_type>( graph );`
 - Just to check, you may call `udgcd::PrintPaths()` to print out the cycles:

   `udgcd::PrintPaths( std::cout, cycles, "cycles" );`
 - Done !

(1) FYI, the type of the returned value is actually
`std::vector<std::vector<my_vertex_t>>` but with C+11, you don't really need that information...

See included samples.

### Building & installing:
 <a name="s_build"></a>

- header only, no build.
- To build & run the provided sample code, just use `make run`, no other dependency than BGL.
(tested with boost 1.54, let me know if you discover any inconsistency with later releases.)

##### Installing
Just copy the file `udgcd.hpp` where you want, or use the provided target of makefile:
`make install` (might require `sudo`).
This will copy the file in `/usr/local/include/`

##### Build options:
 - If the symbol UDGCD_PRINT_STEPS is defined at build time, then different steps will be printed on `std::cout` (useful only for debugging purposes).
 For the provided samples, this can be done by passing option `PRINT_STEPS=Y` to make.

If Graphviz/dot is installed, the demo samples will render the generated graphs into svg images in the `obj` folder.

### Issues:
 <a name="s_issues"></a>

 - At present, this code requires a static allocated variable (done automatically by compiler, as it is templated).
 Thus it is not thread safe, neither can it handle multiple graphs simultaneously.


### How does it work ?
 <a name="s_inside"></a>

Three steps are involved: first we need to check if there **is** at least one cycle. Is this is true, we explore the graph to find it/them.

- The first step is done by a Depth First Search (DFS), with  [boost::undirected_dfs()](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/graph/doc/undirected_dfs.html)
with passing a visitor of class `CycleDetector`, inherited from
[boost::dfs_visitor](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/graph/doc/dfs_visitor.html).
This object holds a set of vertices that are part of an edge on which `back_edge()` is called.
This means that a cycle has been encountered.

- The second step is done by exploring recursively the graph, by starting from each of the vertices that have been identified as part of a "back edge".

- The third steps removes non-chordless cycles.

 ### Notes
  <a name="s_notes"></a>

- In the output vector, the paths are sorted, so you need to have the `<` operator defined for the vertices. Sorting is done such as:
 - The smallest element is in first position;
 - The element in second position is smaller than the last one.

 As an example, say you have a raw cycle expressed as
   `6-2-1-4`, it is released as `1-2-6-4` (and not `1-4-6-2`).

  #### User properties & graph type

You can use whatever edge and vertices types, the coloring needed by the algorithm is handled by providing color maps as external properties. So if you have no special needs on vertices and edge properties, you can use something as trivial as this:
```
    typedef boost::adjacency_list<
	   boost::vecS,
	   boost::vecS,
	   boost::undirectedS
	> graph_t;
```
But you can also have some user properties, defines as bundled properties. For example:
```
struct my_Vertex
{
	int v1;	std::string v2;	float value3;
};
struct my_Edge
{
		int e1; std::string e2;
};
```
Then your graph type definition will become:
```
	typedef boost::adjacency_list<
		boost::vecS,                   // edge container
		boost::vecS,                   // vertex container
		boost::undirectedS,            // type of graph
		my_Vertex,                   // vertex type
		my_Edge
		> graph_t;
```
