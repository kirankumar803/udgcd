# udgld (UnDirected Graph Loop Detection)

C++ wrapper over Boost Graph Library (aka as BGL), provides a mean to detect loops in undirected graphs.

For example, with the following graph, generated by the included sample program:

This code will give you the two loops, as two paths:
```
1-2-3-4-5-6
3-7-14-13-4
```

### Status
- Not extensively tested, but provides sample application code (that works).
- Modern C++ design'ed (RAII).
- Fairly generic, should be suited for pretty much all types of undirected graphs.
- Released under the Boost licence.

### Usage:
 - Include the file `udgld.hpp` in your application.
 - Call the \c UDGLD_INIT macro (outside of `main()` )
 - Build your graph (add vertices and edges, see BGL manual)
 - Call `udgld::FindLoops<your_graph_type,your_vertex_type>( graph )`.
 It will return a set of paths that are loops.
 - Just to check, you may call `udgld::PrintPaths()` to print out the loops.
 - Done !

See `sample_1.cpp` as example.


### Build:
- header only, no build.
- To build the provided sample code, just run makefile, no other dependency than BGL.
(tested with 1.54)

##### Build options:
 - if UDGLD_PRINT_STEPS is defined, then different steps will be printed on `std::cout` (useful only for debugging purposes). See makefile.

### Issues:
 - At present, this code requires a static member that you need to allocate memory for (see macro UDGLD_INIT).
 Thus it is not thread safe, neither can it handle multiple graphs simultaneously.


### How does it work ?

Two steps are involved: first we need to check if there **is** at least one loop. Is this is true,  we explore the graph to find it/them.

- The first step is done by calling [boost::undirected_dfs()](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/graph/doc/undirected_dfs.html)
with passing a visitor of class `LoopDetector`, inherited from
[boost::dfs_visitor](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/libs/graph/doc/dfs_visitor.html).
This object holds a boolean that will turn true if `back_edge()` is ever called.
This means that a loop has been encountered.

- The second step is done once the DFS has been done. We explore recursively the whole graph.
